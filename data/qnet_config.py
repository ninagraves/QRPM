        Quantity state refers to four decoupling points: cp0 (VMI), cp1 (Warehouse), cp3 (PADS inventory - planning
        duplicate), and cp4 (PADS item reservations). All quantity connections are removing.
        The involved objects are: 1 CO, 1 RemainingCO, 1 Parcel, 1 Employee.

        Every execution removes one Box from cp1, other quantity operations differ according to the remaining demand of
        the CO that has to be settled. No more than two parcels may be sent to filfill the full demand of a customer
        order, therefore, the next step is to identify whether this is the first of the second time items are picked
        with regard to the same CO. This is done by comparing the remaining demand with the full demand of the CO.
        If it is the first parcel: The transition is only enabled, if all ordered PADS items are available in the VMI =>
        the quantity operation to cp0 removes all PADS items of the customer order. Furthermore, the reservations for
        these items are removed from cp4 and the removal of the PADS-items from the VMI is booked in the planning
        duplicate cp3. Additionally, the demand for all available non-PADS items is settled in by a removing quantity
        operation to cp1. If it is the second parcel: The transition is only enabled, if the entire remaining demand can
        be settled by the physical inventory. As all PADS items have been removed in the first iteration, there is only
        one non-zero quantity operation => the quantity operation to cp1 removes the entire remaining demand.

        Thus, the quantity operations are determined as follows:
        1) The quantity operation of cp1 always removes one box.
        2) Determine iteration of removal for CO => compare remaining demand to co demand.
            a) First iteration:
                - remove all demanded PADS items from VMI (cp0)
                - remove all reservations for PADS items from cp4
                - remove demand for PADS items from planning duplicate of VMI (cp3)
