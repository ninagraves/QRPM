## Functionality
Added as soon as remaining repository is tidied up enough. Including Screencast.

## Installation
The repository uses poetry for dependency management. If you do not have poetry installed, you can install it by running:
```pip install poetry```
Installation of the full tool has to occur in four steps:
1. Manually install PyGraphviz (needed for the visualisation of the underlying Q-net): https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/package_files/6164164/download
2. To install PyGraphviz in the poetry environment, you must follow the instructions on https://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html
For Windows this means you must run:
```poetry run pip install --config-settings="--global-option=build_ext" `
              --config-settings="--global-option=-IC:\Program Files\Graphviz\include" `
              --config-settings="--global-option=-LC:\Program Files\Graphviz\lib" `
              pygraphviz```
3. Run ```poetry install``` again to synchronise the dependencies
